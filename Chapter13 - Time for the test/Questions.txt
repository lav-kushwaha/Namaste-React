#Unit Testing:
=> Definition: Testing individual units or components of a software application to ensure they work as intended.

#End to end testing :
=>Testing the react application as soon as user land on the website to the user leave to the website.

#For Testing -
=>React Testing Library.

NOTE: When we are building large application its not only build by react we require lots of framework and library to build -
=>ex- For routing we have used react-router-dom and for state management we have used redux and for testing we are using react-testing library.
=>It involve so many things (ex- For bundling we have used parcel)

#NOTE:React-test-library uses something known as JEST.
=>Basically, React-testing-library using JEST behind the scene.

Q.What is JEST ?
=>Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
=>It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!

#Setting up Testing in our app.
    -Install React Testing Library.
    -Installed Jest.
    -Install Babel dependencies
    -configure babel
