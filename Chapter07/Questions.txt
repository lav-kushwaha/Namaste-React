Chapter 07 - Finding the Path.

#About UseEffect Hooks ?
#Point 1.
UseEffect(()=>{
    console.log("Hello")
})
=>If no dependencies array=> UseEffect is called after every component render.

#Point 2.
UseEffect(()=>{
    console.log("Hello")
},[UseEffect render only once after the component render])

=>If there is dependencies array empty [], UseEffect is called only intial component render and just once.

#NOTE : The basic nature and the default behaviour of UseEffect is it is render everytime when the component is render.
=>But if there is empty array [] dependencies UseEffect called only once after component render is finished.-

#Point 3.
UseEffect(()=>{
    console.log("Hello")
},[btnName])
=>if dependencies array is [btnName] => UseEffect Called everytime when [btnName] is updated.

#About UseState Hooks ?
=>UseState() is always used to create local state variable inside our functional component.
#Good Practice to use - Hooks.
=>Always try to use, UseState on top when the function start bcz js is a synchronous single threaded language the code will run line by line.
=>Never use - UseState variable inside if-else condition and function, it is perfectly valid code js allow to do this but don't do this it can create inconsistency in our program.

Q.How react is single page application (SPA) ?
=>React is single page application beacause if we go to new route or new path only components are interchanging them self from one component (ex- App.js or AppLayout) everything is component in react.
=>Only from one component(AppLayout or App.js) if we goto new route it just interchange the component its not reloading a new page thats why we call single page application.
=>This is achieved through client-side routing (handled by tools like React Router), where components dynamically change based on the route, creating a seamless and faster user experience compared to traditional multi-page applications.
=>In react, Just One Component(Page) only component get interchanging via a client side routing its known as SPA. 

Q.How many types of routing in web application ?
