Chapter 07 - Let Get Classy.

Q.What is class Based Components ?
=>Its a normal js class.
#How create class based componet ?
 =>This extends React.Component will make react know this is class based componet.
 =>Class componet have Render(){} method which is return some piece of jsx to display the UI. 
=> ex -
import React from 'react'
class UserClass extends React.Component{
      render(){
          return(
             <div>
                <h2>Hello world</h2>
             <div/>
          ) 
      }
} 
//2nd way to create class by Destructuring React.Component to {Component}
import {Component} from 'react'
class UserClass extends Component{
      render(){
          return(
             <div>
                <h2>Hello world</h2>
             <div/>
          ) 
      }
} 

Q.What is React.Component ?
=>React.component is basically a class which is given to us by react and UserClass is inheriting some properties on it.

Q.How to receive props in class component?
=>if we have to receive props in class component we used constructor and super(props) keyword in class component.
=>ex-
class UserClass extends from React.Component{
    constructor(props){
        super(props)
        console.log(props)
    }
    render(){
        //Destructuring props object.
        const{name,location} = this.props
        return(
            <h2>Hello world</h2>
            //we are using this keyword to receive props.
            <h2>{name}</h2>
            <h3>{location}</h3>
        )
    }
}

Q.Why do we need super(props) in class component ?
=>By using the super constructor with a props argument, the component is able to inherit the properties of the parent component and also access the new props that have been passed in. 
=>This allows the component to make use of the properties of both the parent component and the new props in its render method.
=>allows accessing this. props in a Constructor function. 
=>In fact, what the super() function does is, calls the constructor of the parent class.


Q.What is this.setState ?
=>this.setState({}) are used to update state variable in class component.
=>this.setState({}) takes object and that object takes a variable which is we have to update.
ex-  <button onClick={()=>this.setState(
            {
                count:this.state.count+1,
            }
        )}>Click Me</button>
