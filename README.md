## Topics Covered

### React Hooks
Mastered the use of React Hooks, including useState for managing component state, useEffect for handling side effects, useContext for state across components, and custom hooks for reusable logic.

### State Management
Implemented state management using Redux Toolkit, a powerful library that simplifies the process of managing the state in a predictable way.

### Config Drive UI
Developed dynamic and configurable user interfaces, allowing components to adapt and change based on different configurations.

### Redux Toolkit
Utilized Redux Toolkit for efficient and structured state management in React applications, including actions, reducers, and the Redux store.

### Reusable Components
Created modular and reusable components, promoting code reusability and maintainability across projects.

### Rich and Interactive UI
Designed visually appealing and interactive user interfaces, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Functional Components
Embraced functional components as a fundamental building block in React development, leveraging their simplicity and efficiency.

### Props & State
Mastered the concepts of props and state for effective communication and data management between components.

### List & Keys
Learned the best practices for rendering lists in React, including the importance of using keys for efficient rendering.

### Class Components
Explored class components, understanding their role in legacy codebases and gaining insights into their lifecycle methods.

### Scaling React Apps
Implemented strategies for scaling React applications, ensuring maintainability and performance as projects grow in complexity.

### Best Coding Practices
Adhered to industry best practices for writing clean, readable, and maintainable React code.

### React Router
Navigated through the application using React Router, enabling the creation of single-page applications with seamless navigation.

### Optimizing React Apps
Implemented performance optimizations to enhance the speed and responsiveness of React applications.

### Building Live Projects
Applied acquired skills to real-world projects, gaining practical experience and solidifying understanding.

### Bundlers & Babel
Explored the build process with bundlers like Webpack and transpilers like Babel, understanding how they transform and bundle code.

### JSX
Mastered JSX syntax, the XML-like syntax extension used with React, to create declarative and efficient UI components.

### React.Fragment
Utilized React.Fragment to group multiple elements without adding unnecessary nodes to the DOM.

### Code Splitting
Implemented code splitting techniques to optimize application performance by loading only necessary code chunks.

### Dynamic UI
Created dynamic user interfaces that respond and adapt to user interactions and changing conditions.

### Higher Order Components
Developed higher-order components (HOCs) for code reuse and enhancing component functionality.

### Pure Components
Utilized pure components to optimize rendering and enhance the performance of React applications.

### React Testing Library
Wrote unit tests using React Testing Library to ensure the reliability and robustness of React components.

### Uncontrolled Components
Managed uncontrolled components when needed, understanding their use cases and implementation.

### Building Custom Hooks
Developed custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic across different components.

### Handling Events
Efficiently handled user events, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.

### Conditional Rendering
Dynamically rendered components based on conditions, adapting the UI to different scenarios.

### Tailwind CSS
Styled React components using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, for rapid and consistent styling.
