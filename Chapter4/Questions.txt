#What is props ?
=>Props stands for properties.
=>It is used to passed argument one component to another component - parent component to child component.
=>In ReactJS, the props are a type of object where the value of attributes of a tag is stored. 
=>Basically, these props components are read-only components.
=>Props are immutable, which means that they cannot be modified
=>The word “props” implies “properties”, and its working functionality is quite similar to HTML attributes.
=>React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes:
ex - <Car brand="Ford" />;

V.IMP-NOTE : when you have to dynamically passing some data to component passed as a props.

What is a config driven UI?
+>Config-driven UI is a technique that allows you to create user interfaces based on a configuration file, such as JSON, or a TypeScript file that defines the layout and content of the UI components. 
=>This can be useful for creating dynamic and customizable UIs without hard coding them.
